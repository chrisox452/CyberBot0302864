Once package has downloaded change to mybot directory and run 'pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt'

If ERROR: chatterbot 0.8.7 has requirement sqlalchemy<1.3,>=1.2, but you'll have sqlalchemy 1.3.10 which is incompatible." Run the following commands: 
  pip3.7 install --user SQLAlchemy==1.2.19 
  pip3.7 install --user chatterbot==0.8.7
  
 This should resolve the issue.
